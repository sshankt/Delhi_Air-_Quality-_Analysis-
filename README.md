# 🌍 Air Quality Analysis Using Python

This project analyzes an **Air Quality dataset** containing pollutant levels such as **PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, Ozone** along with the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** over time.  
The goal is to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and pollutant contributions affecting air quality.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Dataset Columns**: `Date`, `Month`, `Year`, `Holidays_Count`, `Days`, `PM2.5`, `PM10`, `NO2`, `SO2`, `CO`, `Ozone`, `AQI`
- **Key Objectives**:
  - Analyze AQI trends over time
  - Compare air quality on holidays vs. working days
  - Identify pollutants most correlated with AQI
  - Detect seasonal patterns and worst/best air quality days

## 📊 Analysis & Insights
1. **AQI Trends Over Time** – AQI spiked during winter months.
2. **Holiday Impact** – AQI improved during long holidays.
3. **Pollutant Correlation** – PM2.5 & PM10 showed the strongest correlation with AQI.
4. **Seasonal Pattern** – November to January had the highest AQI levels.
5. **Top 10 Worst Days** – Linked to events such as festivals & seasonal changes.
